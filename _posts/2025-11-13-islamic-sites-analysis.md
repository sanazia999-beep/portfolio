# Analyzing UNESCO's Recognition of Islamic Heritage Sites Over Time

## Research Question

I wanted to explore whether UNESCO has been recognising more or fewer Islamic heritage sites over the years. 
This question matters because understanding how cultural heritage is preserved and recognised can reveal patterns in global cultural representation and conservation priorities.

## What I Did
Using Python and data analysis, I examined UNESCO World Heritage site descriptions to identify sites connected to Islamic heritage. I searched for keywords like "islam," "mosque," and "muslim" in the official descriptions. My analysis went through several stages:
First, I counted how many Islamic sites were recognised each year
Then I improved this by calculating percentages (what percentage of all sites recognised each year were Islamic)
Finally, I grouped the data into 5-year periods to see broader trends beyond year-to-year fluctuations.

## What I Discovered
The analysis revealed interesting patterns:
The raw counts showed Islamic sites being recognised consistently since the 1980s
When looking at percentages, I noticed that while the absolute numbers might fluctuate, the proportion of Islamic sites among all recognised sites has shown its own distinct pattern
The 5-year period analysis smoothed out annual variations and revealed longer-term trends that weren't obvious in the year-by-year data
The charts suggest that Islamic heritage has maintained a steady presence in UNESCO's recognition, though the patterns differ when viewed as percentages versus raw counts.
