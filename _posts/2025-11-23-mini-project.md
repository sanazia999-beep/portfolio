As I begin my digital humanities mini-project, I am focusing on a research topic closely connected to my MA thesis: the emotional and psychological 
impacts of climate change on women, particularly in remote mountain communities such as northern Pakistan and the Inuit homelands of the Arctic. 
This blog post outlines the datasets I plan to use, the analysis I hope to conduct, and the challenges that I expect to face as the project develops. Corpus and Data Sources.

My project will use a small but meaningful text corpus composed of:
Climate change impact reports from organizations such as:
IPCC
UN Women
UNICEF
BBC
Humanitarian assessments and regional reports on Pakistan, especially Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral
Academic journal articles on climate anxiety, environmental psychology, and eco-feminism
Inuit community studies and testimonies, including public health surveys and cultural climate reports
These documents contain rich qualitative discussions of lived experience: stress, loss of livelihood, altered social roles, and the emotional weight of environmental change. Many of them are open-access and can be downloaded directly from institutional websites. If needed, news articles, interview transcripts, or NGO press releases may expand the dataset later.

## Analytical Goals
Digital humanities methods offer an opportunity to ask new questions of climate-focused narratives.
Some key questions guiding my work include:
How is climate-related emotional distress described in institutional and community texts?
Are women’s experiences framed more in psychological, economic, or social terms?
Which themes appear most frequently anxiety, resilience, trauma, uncertainty, displacement, or cultural loss?
To explore these questions, I am considering methods such as:
Keyword frequency analysis to see how often mental health concepts appear in climate-related writing.
Topic modeling to identify recurring clusters of ideas across different regions and texts.
Sentiment analysis to measure emotional tone and variation.
Named Entity Recognition to map places, organizations, and demographic references. These techniques will help move beyond reading individual reports and instead detect broader patterns in how women’s climate experiences are represented.

## Expected Challenges
Working with this kind of dataset comes with specific challenges:
## Data Format and Standardization
Reports come in different formats PDFs, webpages, Word documents which may require OCR or conversion before computational analysis. Extracting clean text will be an early priority.

## Mixed Terminology
Climate change and mental health are described differently across regions. For example:
Some sources use “eco-anxiety,”
Others focus on “psychosocial impacts,”
Many reports describe emotions indirectly through stories.
This variety may complicate keyword-based analysis.

## Looking Ahead
This mini-project aims to show how digital humanities methods can reveal patterns in climate change narratives that might not appear through conventional close reading. By analyzing how institutions, researchers, and communities talk about environmental stress, especially for women, I hope to highlight emerging psychological realities of the climate crisis and demonstrate the value of computational textual analysis within climate-oriented humanities research.
