This is my first blog post!

<!--more-->

I can insert images, if I put them in the `images` folder, and add a link to the image in my post.

## Formatting

I can add subtitles, like the one above. 

For a new paragraph, I press Enter twice.
If I press Enter only once, the text will be displayed on the same line as the previous one.

Lists are very easy: they can be unordered, like this:

* first item
* another item

If you prefer ordered lists, simply use numbers instead of asterisks:

1. first item
2. a second item
