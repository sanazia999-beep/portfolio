## Research Questions

### Primary Research Question
How does climate change affect the mental well-being of women in vulnerable mountainous communities in Pakistan and Arctic communities?

### Secondary Research Questions
- What psychological impacts (anxiety, depression, PTSD, eco-anxiety) arise from climate-related events?
- What coping strategies do women and men use to handle climate-induced stress?
- How can policies support women’s resilience and mental health?

## Corpus / Dataset

### Dataset Details
This study uses secondary data from academic articles, reports, and case studies.

### Sources
- Peer-reviewed articles (Middleton et al., 2020; Daraz et al., 2024; Lawrance et al., 2022)
- Reports from UN, WHO, World Bank
- Pakistan government climate-disaster reports
- Case studies from five Inuit communities in Labrador, Canada

### Corpus Size & Metadata
- 13–15 journal articles

## Key Challenges

### Language & Translation
Some materials may be in Urdu, Shina, or Burushaski and require translation.

### Data Availability
Gender-specific mental health data is limited in remote regions.

### Comparability
Pakistani and Arctic communities differ in climate patterns, culture, and social structure.

### Ethical Considerations
Sensitive mental health information requires careful handling and cultural respect.
