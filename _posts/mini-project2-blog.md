## Research Questions.

# Primary Research Question:
How does climate change affect the mental well-being of women in vulnerable mountainous communities in Pakistan and Arctic communities?

# Secondary Research Questions:
What specific psychological impacts (e.g., anxiety, depression, PTSD, eco-anxiety) are caused by climate-related events in these regions?
What coping strategies do women and men in these communities adopt to manage climate-induced stress?
How can policies better support women’s resilience and mental health in these regions?<!--more-->

## Corpus/Dataset.

# Dataset Details:
The study primarily relies on secondary data from academic articles, reports, and case studies.

# Sources include:
Journal articles on mental health impacts of climate change (e.g., Middleton et al., 2020; Daraz et al., 2024; Lawrance et al., 2022).
Reports from international organizations like UN, WHO, World Bank, and NGO sources.
Government reports on climate disasters in Pakistan (e.g., floods in 2022).
Case studies of Inuit communities in Labrador, Canada, including demographic and health worker data.

# Corpus Size & Metadata:
Articles: Approx. 13– 15 peer-reviewed journal articles.
Reports: Multiple national and international reports (PDFs, webpages).
Arctic case studies: Data from five Inuit communities (population, gender distribution, age distribution, mental health service access).

# Pakistan data: Secondary statistics on climate-related disasters, gendered vulnerabilities, and mental health service availability.
# Metadata includes: publication date, region, gender focus, type of mental health outcome, and community characteristics.

## Key Challenges.

# Expected Challenges:
Language & Translation:
Some primary sources or interviews may be in local languages (Urdu, Shina, Burushaski), requiring translation for analysis.

# Data Availability & Reliability:
Secondary data may be incomplete, inconsistent, or lack gender-disaggregated statistics, especially in Pakistan’s remote areas.

# Comparability of Data:
Differences in climate events, culture, and community structure between Pakistan and Inuit communities make direct comparisons challenging.

# Ethical Considerations:
Handling sensitive information on mental health and women’s vulnerabilities requires careful anonymization and cultural sensitivity.
