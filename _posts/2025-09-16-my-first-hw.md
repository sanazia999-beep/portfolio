The Digital Guide to Theatre of the Middle East is a project that collects and shares information about plays from the Middle East, North Africa (MENA), and their displaced communities since 2000. Their main goal is to make communication easy and use it for academics, theatre professionals, and producers in the world. The project follows 3 stages: materials, processing, and presentation, but it puts more focus on collecting and presenting the information in an easy and simple way.

The first step is collecting the materials. The team gathers facts about he plays and performances, such as titles, authors, performance dates, and other helpful information like cast lists and the details of production. The language of the plays is in Arabic and Persian, then translated into the original language, and then changed into a digital format. Because of this, the work preserves valuable knowledge and makes sure it can be easily stored, searched, and easily accessible in the future for research.

The second step is processing. This includes creating and structuring the collected data so it can be used effectively. Instead of doing complicated computer analysis, the team focuses on datafication, converting performance details into arranged digital records. It allows users to easily sort, filter, and search the database. This step happens behind the scenes.

The third step is presentation, which shares all the organized data through a friendly website. The navigation and design of the site make users understand and research the material. The project’s force lies in its collection of theatre and its easily accessible presentation.

The project follows Ducker’s 3 stages, but places its strong importance on materials and presentation. The stage of processing is present but appears focused on the construction of the data and management rather than on difficult computational analysis.
